## About me
26 years, born in Brazil, currently living in the Brazil. I seek learn a new thing everyday, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

## Summary
I like to say: "I solve problems and give systems working assurance: first I build and make it work, then I improve."

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer who love this carrer, 3+ years experience building APIs, web apps and mobile apps. I specialize in JavaScript and Flutter and have professional experience working with NodeJS, Vue, Hasura, Docker, AWS, Elixir and of course Flutter. I also have some experience or experimental attempts with C# (.NET core), React and React Native. Take a look at my projects on github or get in touch! I don't have many public projects available on my github, but I'm working on filling it out.

I am passionate about knowledge and I work every day to be the best version of myself.
